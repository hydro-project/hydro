Analysis & Refined Plan
Your plan is excellent! Here are some refinements I'd suggest:

Current State:
ReactFlow visualization works by creating an HTML file with embedded JSON and opening it in a browser
The HTML template includes ReactFlow.js, ELK layout engine, and sophisticated UI controls
The system currently uses super::debug::open_reactflow_browser() which creates a temp HTML file
Refined Plan:
Move visualization to docs with enhanced features âœ…

Create /docs/src/pages/visualizer.js for the ReactFlow component
Leverage existing docs infrastructure (React, styling, etc.)
Add drag-and-drop for JSON files
Support URL-encoded JSON like mermaid.live
URL encoding strategy (Enhanced from your plan)

Use Base64URL encoding like the current mermaid implementation
Format: /visualizer#data=<base64-encoded-json>
This is more robust than query params for large JSON
Backwards compatibility (Addition to your plan)

Keep the current template-based system as a fallback
Add a new method that redirects to the docs page
This ensures existing code continues to work
Progressive enhancement (Addition to your plan)

Add a "Open in Docs Visualizer" button to the current HTML template
This provides a migration path for users

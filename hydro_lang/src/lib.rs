//! Hydro is a high-level distributed programming framework for Rust.
//! Hydro can help you quickly write scalable distributed services that are correct by construction.
//! Much like Rust helps with memory safety, Hydro helps with [distributed safety](https://hydro.run/docs/hydro/correctness).
//!
//! The core Hydro API involves [live collections](https://hydro.run/docs/hydro/live-collections/), which represent asynchronously
//! updated sources of data such as incoming network requests and application state. The most common live collection is
//! [`live_collections::stream::Stream`]; other live collections can be found in [`live_collections`].
//!
//! Hydro uses a unique compilation approach where you define deployment logic as Rust code alongside your distributed system implementation.
//! For more details on this API, see the [Hydro docs](https://hydro.run/docs/hydro/deploy/) and the [`deploy`] module.

    //! The prelude may grow over time as additional items see ubiquitous use.

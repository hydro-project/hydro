/**
 * Container Abstraction Level Tests
 *
 * Tests the bidirectional operations between different levels of abstraction:
 * - LIFTING: Making things more abstract (collapse containers → hide details)
 * - GROUNDING: Making things more concrete (expand containers → reveal details)
 *
 * These are inverse operations that should be perfectly symmetric.

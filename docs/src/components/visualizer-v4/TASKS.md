TASKS:
- enhance widgets in StyleTunerPanel to show the values of the settings, so I can copy them into config.ts
- DRY, clean up, check encapsulation of any index structure modifications
- Search/Graph Filtering/Focus: in treeview?
- Centralize any stray constants

FIXS:
- clean up smartCollapse and validateHyperEdgeLifting
- remove redundant tests?
- Tests should not regex on error messages, they should look for error IDs. Is there a TS best practice for this?

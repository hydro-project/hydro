/**
 * Container Operations Test Suite
 *
 * Comprehensive tests for container collapse/expand functionality, including:
 * - Basic CRUD operations (nodes, edges, containers)
 * - Symmetric collapse/expand operations
 * - Complex cross-container scenarios
 * - Edge lifting/grounding with hyperedge management
 * - Bug fixes for hyperedge preservation and state consistency
 *
 * This test suite ensures robust container hierarchy management and proper
 * edge routing during container state transitions.

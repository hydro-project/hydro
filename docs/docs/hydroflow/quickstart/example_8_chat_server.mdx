# Networked Services 2: Chat Server
> In this example we cover:
> * Multiple message types and the [`demux`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen.md#demux) operator.
> * A broadcast pattern via the [`cross_join`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen.md#cross_join) operator.
> * One-time bootstrapping pipelines
> * A "gated buffer" pattern via `cross_join` with a single-object input.

Our previous [echo server](./example_7_echo_server) example was admittedly simplistic.  In this example, we'll build something a bit more useful: a simple chat server. We will again have two roles: a `Client` and a `Server`. `Clients` will register their presence with the `Server`, which maintains a list of clients. Each `Client` sends messages to the `Server`, which will then broadcast those messages to all other clients.

## Project files

### `Cargo.toml`
We will use a text-coloring crate called `colored` in this example.
To follow along, add the following line to the bottom of the `Cargo.toml` file
that appears at that root of your template:

```toml
colored = "2.0.0"
```

### `main.rs`
The `main.rs` file here is very similar to that of the echo server, just with two new command-line arguments: one called `name` for a "nickname" in the chatroom, and another optional argument `graph` for printing a dataflow graph if desired. To follow along, you can copy the contents of this file into the `src/main.rs` file of your template.

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{main}</CodeBlock>

### `protocol.rs`
Our protocol file here expands upon what we saw with the echoserver by defining multiple message types.
Replace the template contents of `src/protocol.rs` with the following:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{protocol}</CodeBlock>

Note how we use a single Rust `enum` to represent all varieties of message types; this allows us to handle `Message`s of different types with a single  Rust network channel. We will use the [`demux`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen.md#demux) operator to separate out these different message types on the receiving end.

The `ConnectRequest` and `ConnectResponse` messages have no payload;
the address of the sender and the type of the message will be sufficient information. The `ChatMsg` message type has a `nickname` field, a `message` field, and a `ts`
field for the timestamp. Once again we use the `chrono` crate to represent timestamps.

### `server.rs`
The chat server is nearly as simple as the echo server. The main differences are (a) we need to handle multiple message types,
(b) we need to keep track of the list of clients, and (c) we need to broadcast messages to all clients.

To follow along, replace the contents of `src/server.rs` with the code below:

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(server, 1, 24)}</CodeBlock>

After a short prelude, we have the Hydroflow code near the top of `run_server()`. It begins by defining `outbound_chan` as a `union`ed destination sink for network messages. Then we get to the
more interesting `inbound_chan` definition.

The `inbound` channel is a source stream that will carry many
types of `Message`s. 
We first use a `map` operator to `unwrap` the Rust `Result` type that comes from deserializing the input
from `source_stream_serde`.
Then we use the [`demux`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen.md#demux) operator to partition the stream objects into three channels. The `clients` channel
will carry the addresses of clients that have connected to the server. The `msgs` channel will carry the `ChatMsg` messages that clients send to the server.
The `errs` channel will carry any other messages that clients send to the server.

Note the structure of the `demux` operator: it takes a closure on
`(Message, SocketAddr)` pairs, and a variadic tuple (`var_args!`) of the output channel namesâ€”in this case `clients`, `msgs`, and `errs`. The closure is basically a big
Rust pattern [`match`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html), with one arm for each output channel name given in the variadic tuple. Note
that each output channel can have its own message type! Note also that we destructure the incoming `Message` types into component fields. (If we didn't we'd have to write boilerplate code to handle every possible `Message` type in every downstream pipeline!)

The remainder of the server consists of two independent pipelines, the code to print out the flow graph,
and the code to run the flow graph. To follow along, paste the following into the bottom of your `src/server.rs` file:

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(server, 26, 55)}</CodeBlock>

The first pipeline is one line long,
and is responsible for acknowledging requests from `clients`: it takes the address of the incoming `Message::ConnectRequest`
and sends a `ConnectResponse` back to that address. The second pipeline is responsible for broadcasting
all chat messages to all clients. This all-to-all pairing corresponds to the notion of a cartesian product
or [`cross_join`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen.md#cross_join) in Hydroflow. The `cross_join` operator takes two input
channels and produces a single output channel with a tuple for each pair of inputs, in this case it produces
`(Message, SocketAddr)` pairs. Conveniently, that is exactly the structure needed for sending to the `outbound_chan` sink!
We call the cross-join pipeline `broadcast` because it effectively broadcasts all messages to all clients.

The mermaid graph for the server is below. The three branches of the `demux` are very clear toward the top. Note also the `tee` of the `clients` channel
for both `ClientResponse` and broadcasting, and the `union` of all outbound messages into `dest_sink_serde`.

### `client.rs`
The chat client is not very different from the echo server client, with two new design patterns:
 1. a `initialize` operator that runs once to "bootstrap" action in the first tick
 2. the use of `cross_join` as a "gated buffer" to postpone sending messages.

We also include a Rust helper routine `pretty_print_msg` for formatting output.

The prelude of the file is almost the same as the echo server client, with the addition of the crate for
handling `colored` text output. This is followed by the `pretty_print_msg` function, which is fairly self-explanatory.
To follow along, start by replacing the contents of `src/client.rs` with the following:

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(client, 1, 27)}</CodeBlock>

This brings us to the `run_client` function. As in `run_server` we begin by ensuring the server address
is supplied. We then have the hydroflow code starting with a standard pattern of a `union`ed `outbound_chan`,
and a `demux`ed `inbound_chan`. The client handles only two inbound `Message` types: `Message::ConnectResponse` and `Message::ChatMsg`.

Paste the following to the bottom of `src/client.rs`:

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(client, 29, 45)}</CodeBlock>

The core logic of the client consists of three dataflow pipelines shown below. Paste this into the
bottom of your `src/client.rs` file.

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(client, 47, 64)}</CodeBlock>

1. The first pipeline is the "bootstrap" alluded to above.
It starts with the `initialize` operator that emits a single, opaque "unit" (`()`) value. This value is emitted when the client begins, which means
this pipeline runs once, immediately on startup, and generates a single `ConnectRequest` message which is sent to the server.

2. The second pipeline reads from `source_stdin` and sends messages to the server. It differs from our echo-server example in the use of a `cross_join`
with `inbound_chan[acks]`. This cross-join is similar to that of the server: it forms pairs between all messages and all servers that send a `ConnectResponse` ack.
In principle this means that the client is broadcasting each message to all servers.
In practice, however, the client establishes at most one connection to a server. Hence over time, this pipeline starts with zero `ConnectResponse`s and is sending no messages;
subsequently it receives a single `ConnectResponse` and starts sending messages. The `cross_join` is thus effectively a buffer for messages, and a "gate" on that buffer that opens
when the client receives its sole `ConnectResponse`.

3. The final pipeline simply pretty-prints the messages received from the server.

Finish up the file by pasting the code below for optionally generating the graph and running the flow:

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(client, 65, 85)}</CodeBlock>

The client's mermaid graph looks a bit different than the server's, mostly because it routes some data to
the screen rather than to an outbound network channel.

## Running the example
As described in `hydroflow/hydroflow/example/chat/README.md`, we can run the server in one terminal, and run clients in additional terminals.
The server's `addr` and the client's `server-addr` need to agree or this won't work!

<>{/* TODO(mingwei): automate this example output */}</>

Fire up the server in terminal 1:
```console
#shell-command-next-line
cargo run -- --name "_" --role server --addr 127.0.0.1:12347
```

Start client "alice" in terminal 2 and type some messages, and you'll see them
echoed back to you. This will appear in colored fonts in most terminals
(but unfortunately not in this markdown-based book!)
```console
#shell-command-next-line
cargo run -- --name "alice" --role client --server-addr 127.0.0.1:12347
Listening on 127.0.0.1:50460
Client live!
Hello (hello hello) ... is there anybody in here?
May 31, 5:12:23 alice: Hello (hello hello) ... is there anybody in here?
Just nod if you can hear me.
May 31, 5:12:36 alice: Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone home?
May 31, 5:12:40 alice: Is there anyone home?
```

Now start client "bob" in terminal 3, and notice how he instantly receives the backlog of Alice's messages from the server's `cross_join`.
(The messages may not be printed in the same order as they were timestamped! The `cross_join` operator is not guaranteed to preserve order, nor
is the udp network. Fixing these issues requires extra client logic (perhaps using the [`sort()`](../syntax/surface_ops_gen#sort) operator) that we leave as an exercise to the reader.)
```console
#shell-command-next-line
cargo run -- --name "bob" --role client --server-addr 127.0.0.1:12347
Listening on 127.0.0.1:49298
Client live!
May 31, 5:12:23 alice: Hello (hello hello) ... is there anybody in here?
May 31, 5:12:36 alice: Just nod if you can hear me.
May 31, 5:12:40 alice: Is there anyone home?
```
Now in terminal 3, Bob can respond:
```console
*nods*
May 31, 5:13:43 bob: *nods*
```
and if we go back to terminal 2 we can see that Alice gets the message too:
```console
May 31, 5:13:43 bob: *nods*
```

# Quickstart
In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of Hydro by building a key-value store. We'll start with a single register, which holds a single value, and build up to a full store that partitions its keys across a cluster of machine. Along the way, we'll cover many core pieces of Hydro, such as live collections, batches and snapshots, and simulation testing.

**You will learn:**
- How to use live collections to handle RPC requests and store application state
- How to test complex concurrency scenarios with Hydro's deterministic simulator
- How to use slices to manipulate snapshots of asynchronous state

## Creating a Hydro Project
To get started with a new project, we'll use the Hydro template. The template comes with a simple distributed program.

:::info

Hydro is a Rust framework, so you will need to install Rust. We recommend using `rustup`, which allows you to easily manage and update Rust versions: [**Install Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Hydro code is written with standard Rust tools. You'll manage dependencies, run tests, and launch Hydro programs using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), the standard Rust package manager.
We recommend using VS Code with the [**Rust Analyzer**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension, which provides inline errors and code completion

:::

To generate the template, we will install the `cargo-generate` utility and then expand the template into a folder of our choice.

```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo install cargo-generate
#shell-command-next-line
cargo generate gh:hydro-project/hydro-template
# Project Name: my-example-project
#shell-command-next-line
cd my-example-project
```

After `cd`ing into the generated folder, we can run tests for the included sample:
```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo test
```

Hydro projects are typically organized into two folders:
- **`src/`** contains the main distributed logic and tests (like regular Rust)
- **`examples/`** contains deployment scripts for launching to the cloud

Under the hood, Hydro uses a library called Stageleft to power the `q!` macro and code generation logic. 

:::note

Hydro programmers need not understand how to use Stageleft; this information is provided here for readers
interested in how its `q!` macro works.

:::

For detailed documentation on Stageleft's architecture and the `q!` macro, see the [Stageleft README](https://github.com/hydro-project/stageleft/blob/main/README.md).

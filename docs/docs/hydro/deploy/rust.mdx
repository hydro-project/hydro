# Hydro Deploy

Hydro comes equipped with a Rust-native built-in deployment system, **Hydro Deploy**, which allows you to deploy your
Hydro app to a variety of platforms. With Hydro Deploy, you can spin up complex services with just a few lines of Rust!
{/* TODO(mingwei): This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your Hydro app in a variety of scenarios. */}

We have actually already been using Hydro Deploy in all of the examples so far, but without any special
configuration:

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="examples/first_ten.rs">{firstTenExampleSrc}</CodeBlock>

TODO(mingwei): Explain the details/nuances of the example and simple configurations.

## `TrybuildHost`

`TrybuildHost` provides additional options for compiling your Hydro app, such as setting [`rustflags`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#buildrustflags),
enabling [features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html), or setting up [performance profiling](#performance-profiling).

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="hydro_test/examples/perf_compute_pi.rs">{getLines(perfComputePiSrc, "trybuildhost")}</CodeBlock>

TODO(mingwei)

## Performance Profiling

Hydro Deploy also supports performance profiling with flamegraphs, which can be used to visualize which parts of your
code are taking the most time to execute.

`TrybuildHost` provides a `tracing` method that will automatically generate a flamegraph after your app has run:

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="hydro_test/examples/perf_compute_pi.rs">{getLines(perfComputePiSrc, "tracing")}</CodeBlock>

The `TracingOptions` builder has several options, such as sampling frequency, output file names, tracing options, and
optionally a setup command to run before the profiling starts. The `setup_command` can be used to install the profiling,
in this case we use the provided `DEBIAN_PERF_SETUP_COMMAND` which installs `perf` and sets some kernel parameters to
enable tracing.

You may need to use `TrybuildHost` to set the following `rustflags` to enable detailed performance profiling:
<CodeBlock language="rust" title="hydro_test/examples/perf_compute_pi.rs">{getLines(perfComputePiSrc, "rustflags")}</CodeBlock>

Different platforms require particular configuration to enable CPU profiling. Each platform uses a different tool to collect
CPU profiling data, but Hydro Deploy will automatically process the resulting traces and download the resulting flamegraph:

* Linux: `perf` for CPU profiling
* macOS: `samply` for CPU profiling
* Windows: `samply` for CPU profiling

For example, on GCP Linux machines, you may need to include additional `rustflags`:
<CodeBlock language="rust" title="hydro_test/examples/perf_compute_pi.rs">{getLines(perfComputePiSrc, "rustflags_gcp")}</CodeBlock>

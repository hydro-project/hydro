Hydro uses a library called Stageleft to power the `q!` macro and code generation logic. 

For detailed documentation on Stageleft's architecture and the `q!` macro, see the [Stageleft README](https://github.com/hydro-project/stageleft/blob/main/README.md).

:::note

Hydro programmers need not understand how Stageleft works under the hood; this information is provided here for readers interested in how its `q!` macro works.

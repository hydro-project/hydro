# Quoting Errors
Quoting relies on advanced features of Rust, and can sometimes emit strange type errors. This page covers the current limitations and workarounds for common quoting errors.

:::note

The Hydro team is also working with members of the Rust language team to explore upstreaming the quoting features into Rust itself. While this effort is in the early days, we hope that upstreaming will eliminate these edge cases.

## References to Local Functions
Currently, code inside a `q!` macro must use `self::` paths when invoking a local function. For example, in this code invoking `foo` will not compile but `self::foo` works as expected:

```rust,ignore
# use stageleft::*;
fn foo() {}

fn uses_foo_quoted() {
  q!(|| foo()) // don't do this, compiler error
  q!(|| self::foo()) // works!
}
```

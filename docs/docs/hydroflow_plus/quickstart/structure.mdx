# Your First Dataflow
Hydroflow+ programs require special structure to support code generation and distributed deployments. There are two main components of a Hydroflow+ program:
- The **flow graph** describes the dataflow logic of the program.
- The **deployment** describes how to map the flow graph to a physical deployment.

:::tip

We recommend using the Hydroflow+ template to get started with a new project. The template comes with a pre-configured build system and the following example pre-implemented.

```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cargo install cargo-generate
#shell-command-next-line
cargo generate gh:hydro-project/hydroflow template/hydroflow_plus
```

`cd` into the generated folder, ensure the correct nightly version of rust is installed, and test the generated project:
```bash
#shell-command-next-line
cd <my-project>
#shell-command-next-line
rustup update
#shell-command-next-line
cargo test
```

Let's look a minimal example of a Hydroflow+ program. We'll start with a simple flow graph that prints out the first 10 natural numbers. First, we'll define the **flow graph**.


## The Flow Graph

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/first_ten_distributed.rs">{getLines(firstTenSrc, 1, 17)}</CodeBlock>

To build a Hydroflow+ application, we need to define a dataflow that spans multiple processes. The `FlowBuilder` parameter captures the global dataflow, and we can instantiate processes to define boundaries between distributed logic. When defining a process, we also pass in a type parameter to a "tag" that identifies the process. When transforming streams, the Rust type system will guarantee that we are operating on streams on the same process.

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(firstTenSrc, 8, 9)}</CodeBlock>

Now, we can build out the dataflow to run on this process. Every dataflow starts at a source that is bound to a specific process. First, we instantiate a stream that emits the first 10 natural numbers.

<CodeBlock language="rust">{getLines(firstTenSrc, 11)}</CodeBlock>

In Hydroflow+, whenever there are snippets of Rust code passed to operators (like `source_iter`, `map`, or `for_each`), we use the `q!` macro to mark them. For example, we may use Rust snippets to define static sources of data or closures that transform them.

To print out these numbers, we can use the `for_each` operator (note that the body of `for_each` is a closure wrapped in `q!`):

In the next section, we will look at how to deploy this program to run on multiple processs.

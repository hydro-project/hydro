### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-939389953875bf5f94ea84503a7a35efd7342282/> mark non-deterministic operators as unsafe and introduce timestamped streams
   Big PR.
   
   First big change is we introduce a `Timestamped` location. This is a bit
   of a hybrid between top-level locations and `Tick` locations. The idea
   is that you choose where timestamps are generated, and then have a
   guarantee that everything after that will be atomically computed (useful
   for making sure we add payloads to the log before ack-ing).
   
   The contract is that an operator or module that takes a `Timestamped`
   input must still be deterministic regardless of the stamps on messages
   (which are hidden unless you `tick_batch`). But unlike a top-level
   stream (which has the same constraints), you have the atomicity
   guarantee. Right now the guarantee is trivial since we have one global
   tick for everything. But in the future when we want to apply
   @davidchuyaya's optimizations this will be helpful to know when there
   are causal dependencies on when data can be sent to others.
   
   Second change is we mark every non-deterministic operator (modulo
   explicit annotations such as `NoOrder`) with Rust's `unsafe` keyword.
   This makes it super clear where non-determinism is taking place.
   
   I've used this to put `unsafe` blocks throughout our example code and
   add `SAFETY` annotations that argue why the non-determinism is safe (or
   point out that we've explicitly documented / expect non-determinism). I
   also added `#![warn(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]` to the examples and the
   template, since this forces good hygiene of annotating sources of
   non-determinism even inside a module that is intentionally
   non-deterministic.
   
   Paxos changes are mostly refactors, and I verified that the performance
   is the same as before.

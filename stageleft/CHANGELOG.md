## v0.4.0 (2024-08-30)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-11af32828bab6e4a4264d2635ff71a12bb0bb778/> lower min dependency versions where possible, update `Cargo.lock`
   Moved from #1418
   
   ---------

### New Features

 - <csr-id-46a8a2cb08732bb21096e824bc4542d208c68fb2/> use trybuild to compile subgraph binaries

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-06c514179bacafb52aceaed4c92367176c656822/> typing hole when splicing `RuntimeData`
   Previously, a `RuntimeData` could be spliced in any context even if its
   data type may not be valid under the required `'a` lifetime constraint.
   This fixed that typing bug.
   
   Soon, we should have regression testing for this via trybuild.

## v0.2.1 (2024-04-05)

<csr-id-7958fb0d900be8fe7359326abfa11dcb8fb35e8a/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-77f3e5afb9e276d1d6c643574ebac75ed0003939/> simplify lifetime bounds for processes and clusters
   feat(hydroflow_plus): simplify lifetime bounds for processes and
   clusters
   
   This allows `extract` to move the flow builder, which is a prerequisite
   for having developers run the optimizer during deployment as well in
   case it changes the network topology.

### Style

 - <csr-id-7958fb0d900be8fe7359326abfa11dcb8fb35e8a/> qualified path cleanups for clippy

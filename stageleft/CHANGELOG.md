## 0.6.0 (2024-12-23)

<csr-id-ec55910f5a41d4f08059b5feda4b96fbd058c959/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-53da4c1c9b18562e7806adcaf3a3838f56b8ef1b/> extract initial Hydroflow+ utilities into a standard library

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-f6989baf12631cf43a814123e274466740c2f159/> restrict lifetime parameters to be actually invariant
   Our lifetimes were accidentally made covariant when the lifetime `'a`
   was removed from the process/cluster tag type. This fixes that typing
   hole, and also loosens some restrictions on the lifetime of deploy
   environments.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-ec55910f5a41d4f08059b5feda4b96fbd058c959/> generalize quorum logic

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-28cd220c68e3660d9ebade113949a2346720cd04/> add `repository` field to `Cargo.toml`s, fix #1452
   #1452 
   
   Will trigger new releases of the following:
   `unchanged = 'hydroflow_deploy_integration', 'variadics',
   'variadics_macro', 'pusherator'`
   
   (All other crates already have changes, so would be released anyway)
 - <csr-id-e1a08e5d165fbc80da2ae695e507078a97a9031f/> update `CHANGELOG.md`s for big rename
   Generated before rename per `RELEASING.md` instructions.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-939389953875bf5f94ea84503a7a35efd7342282/> mark non-deterministic operators as unsafe and introduce timestamped streams
   Big PR.
   
   First big change is we introduce a `Timestamped` location. This is a bit
   of a hybrid between top-level locations and `Tick` locations. The idea
   is that you choose where timestamps are generated, and then have a
   guarantee that everything after that will be atomically computed (useful
   for making sure we add payloads to the log before ack-ing).
   
   The contract is that an operator or module that takes a `Timestamped`
   input must still be deterministic regardless of the stamps on messages
   (which are hidden unless you `tick_batch`). But unlike a top-level
   stream (which has the same constraints), you have the atomicity
   guarantee. Right now the guarantee is trivial since we have one global
   tick for everything. But in the future when we want to apply
   @davidchuyaya's optimizations this will be helpful to know when there
   are causal dependencies on when data can be sent to others.
   
   Second change is we mark every non-deterministic operator (modulo
   explicit annotations such as `NoOrder`) with Rust's `unsafe` keyword.
   This makes it super clear where non-determinism is taking place.
   
   I've used this to put `unsafe` blocks throughout our example code and
   add `SAFETY` annotations that argue why the non-determinism is safe (or
   point out that we've explicitly documented / expect non-determinism). I
   also added `#![warn(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]` to the examples and the
   template, since this forces good hygiene of annotating sources of
   non-determinism even inside a module that is intentionally
   non-deterministic.
   
   Paxos changes are mostly refactors, and I verified that the performance
   is the same as before.
 - <csr-id-a93a5e59e1681d325b3433193bb86254d23bdc77/> allow cluster self ID to be referenced as a global constant
   This eliminates the need to store `cluster.self_id()` in a local
   variable first, instead you can directly reference `CLUSTER_SELF_ID`.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-06c514179bacafb52aceaed4c92367176c656822/> typing hole when splicing `RuntimeData`
   Previously, a `RuntimeData` could be spliced in any context even if its
   data type may not be valid under the required `'a` lifetime constraint.
   This fixed that typing bug.
   
   Soon, we should have regression testing for this via trybuild.

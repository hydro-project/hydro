## v0.5.5 (2024-07-23)

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-b4e226f1305a9631083bb6e9c7e5f01cc7c9aa90/> add `#[derive(Lattice)]` docs to README, import into book, fix #1259

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b3d01c20cae2335a3da2c02343debe677f17786b/> add `#[derive(Lattice)]` derive macros, fix #1247
   This adds derive macros to allow user-created macros. Each field must be
   a lattice.
   
   Example usage:
   ```rust
   struct MyLattice<KeySet, Epoch>
   where
   KeySet: Collection,
   Epoch: Ord,
   {
   keys: SetUnion<KeySet>,
   epoch: Max<Epoch>,
   }
   ```
   
   Uses `#[derive(Lattice)]` for the `lattices` library `Pair` lattice.
   Also contains some cleanup in the `lattices` crate.

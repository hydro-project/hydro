# Introduction

[Hydroflow](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow) is a dataflow runtime
written in Rust, serving as the execution layer of the [Hydro stack](https://hydro-project.github.io/).
This book teaches how to set up and get started with Hydroflow.

Keep in mind that Hydroflow is under active development and is constantly
changing. However this book is tested in CI so should always be up-to-date
(though incomplete, for now).

If you have any questions, feel free to [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/hydro-project/hydroflow/issues/new).

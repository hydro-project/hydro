# A Branching Example

So far all the operators we've used have one input and one output and therefore
create a linear graph. Let's now take a look at a subgraph which has multiple
merging together, and branches out to multiple outputs. We'll also introduce
a simple way to accept external inputs into the Hydroflow graph.

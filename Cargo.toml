    # When adding a new crate which is published, you will need to:
    # 1. run `cargo changelog --write my_crate`
    # 2. Edit `my_crate/CHANGELOG.md` and change `## Unreleased` to `## 0.0.0 (2023-05-02)` (use
    # current date).
    # 3. Tag the commit with `my_crate-v0.0.0` and push the tag.
    # 4. Publish `my_crate` locally using `cargo publish -p my_crate`.
    # Then in the future you can just run the release workflow normally.

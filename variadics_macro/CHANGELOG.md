## v0.6.0 (2025-03-08)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-49a387d4a21f0763df8ec94de73fb953c9cd333a/> upgrade to Rust 2024 edition
   - Updates `Cargo.toml` to use new shared workspace keys
   - Updates lint settings (in workspace `Cargo.toml`)
   - `rustfmt` has changed slightly, resulting in a big diff - there are no
   actual code changes
   - Adds a script to `rustfmt` the template src files

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c49a4913cfdae021404a86e5a4d0597aa4db9fbe/> reduce where `#[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` needs to be used
   Simplifies the logic for generating the public clone of the code, which
   eliminates the need to sprinkle `#[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` (renamed
   from `#[stageleft::runtime]`) everywhere. Also adds logic to pass
   through `cfg` attrs when re-exporting public types.

## v0.5.5 (2024-11-08)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f7e740fb2ba36d0fcf3fd196d60333552911e3a4/> generalized hash trie indexes for relational tuples
   Generalized Hash Tries are part of the SIGMOD '23 FreeJoin
   [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3589295) by
   Wang/Willsey/Suciu. They provide a compressed ("factorized")
   representation of relations. By operating in the factorized domain, join
   algorithms can defer cross-products and achieve asymptotically optimal
   performance.

<csr-id-38e6721be69f6a41aa47a01a9d06d56a01be1355/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-38e6721be69f6a41aa47a01a9d06d56a01be1355/> remove stageleft from repo, fix #1764
   They grow up so fast ðŸ¥¹

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-b235a42a3071e55da7b09bdc8bc710b18e0fe053/> demote python deploy docs, fix docsrs configs, fix #1392, fix #1629
   Running thru the quickstart in order to write more about Rust
   `hydro_deploy`, ran into some confusion due to feature-gated items not
   showing up in docs.
   
   `rustdocflags = [ '--cfg=docsrs', '--cfg=stageleft_runtime' ]` uses the
   standard `[cfg(docrs)]` as well as enabled our
   `[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` so things `impl<H: Host + 'static>
   IntoProcessSpec<'_, HydroDeploy> for Arc<H>` show up.
   
   Also set `--all-features` for the docsrs build

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7f0a9e8ef59adf462ddd4b798811ec32e61bcb47/> add benchmarking utilities

### Chore

 - <csr-id-49a387d4a21f0763df8ec94de73fb953c9cd333a/> upgrade to Rust 2024 edition
   - Updates `Cargo.toml` to use new shared workspace keys
   - Updates lint settings (in workspace `Cargo.toml`)
   - `rustfmt` has changed slightly, resulting in a big diff - there are no
   actual code changes
   - Adds a script to `rustfmt` the template src files

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2fd6119afed850a0c50ecc69e5c4d8de61a2f4cb/> rename `_interleaved` to `_anonymous`
   Also address docs feedback for streams.
 - <csr-id-524fa67232b54f5faeb797b43070f2f197c558dd/> rename timestamp to atomic and provide batching shortcuts

   Allows specifying a distribution policy (for deciding which partition to
   send each message to) before networking. Designed to be as easy as
   possible to inject (so the distribution policy function definition takes
   in the cluster ID, for example, even though it doesn't need to, because
   this way we can avoid project->map->join)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-75eb323a612fd5d2609e464fe7690bc2b6a8457a/> use correct `__staged` path when rewriting `crate::` imports
   Previously, a rewrite would first turn `crate` into `crate::__staged`,
   and another would rewrite `crate::__staged` into `hydro_test::__staged`.
   The latter global rewrite is unnecessary because the stageleft logic
   already will use the full crate name when handling public types, so we
   drop it.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c49a4913cfdae021404a86e5a4d0597aa4db9fbe/> reduce where `#[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` needs to be used
   Simplifies the logic for generating the public clone of the code, which
   eliminates the need to sprinkle `#[cfg(stageleft_runtime)]` (renamed
   from `#[stageleft::runtime]`) everywhere. Also adds logic to pass
   through `cfg` attrs when re-exporting public types.
